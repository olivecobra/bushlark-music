      <span>Ray Grieve was the vocalist and rhythm guitarist in 1960s Sydney rock and blues bands including the <strong>Elliot Gordon Union</strong>. He played flute and tin whistle in traditional Australian folk bands and was one of the founding members of <strong>The Rouseabouts</strong> within the Bush Music Club in the 1970s.</span>
      <br><br>
      <span>He has written and published two books on the history of the harmonica in Australia, which he began researching and collecting materials for in 1981. <strong>A Band in a Waistcoat Pocket</strong> (Currency Press) and the companion tape and CD sets of original historic Australia mouth organ recordings (Larrikin Records) was launched by the late Larry Adler, legendary American harmonica player, in 1995. <strong>Boomerangs and Crackajacks</strong>, the book and CD written and produced by Ray, was launched at the 2014 National Folk Festival in Canberra by Kevin Bradley, Director of Sound and Preservation at the National Library. Bob Bolton of the Bush Music Club played mouth organ at the launch, demonstrating the style of the Australian Champions of the past.</span>
      <br><br>
      <span>His most recent band, <strong>Bushlark</strong>, has released two independent CD albums, in which Ray performs vocals, flute, tin whistles and other various folk-wind instruments. These albums are titled Ready River Flute (2000) and For Now (2007).</span>
